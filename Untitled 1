UPDATES:

Doing big refactoring of code to make it less verbose, more efficient and easier to edit and extend in future. 

Date Receiver and Time Receivers look very similar just now, could they extend from a superclass?

I think the trigger layout should be redesigned to accommodate the new date objects and pickers. 

Should the different date options be in their own components?

Also UI elements should be over in the UI bit
